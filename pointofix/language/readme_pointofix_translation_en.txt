How to use the Pointofix Language Pack
--------------------------------------

1) First install the german Pointofix version 1.8.0.2017.02.18 (or higher).

2) Then copy the desired translation file (e.g. "pointofix_translation_en.ini"
for the english version) from the language pack into the Pointofix directory
(e.g. "C:\Program Files\Pointofix\").

3) Rename the file to "pointofix_translation.ini"
(e.g. "pointofix_translation_en.ini" -> "pointofix_translation.ini")

4) Then restart Pointofix. Finish!

Remark: If your windows system doesn't show file extensions, then you should remember, that there's a difference between the filename you see and the real filename. So if your language doesn't work, try to delete the ".inc" extension and just name the file to "pointofix_translation" because your system will add the ".inc" extension automatically.
